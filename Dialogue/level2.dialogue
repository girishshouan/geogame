	Wanderer of the endless dunes, you have stumbled upon the realm of the Sphinx. Heed my words, for the sands you tread hold secrets old as time. Before you lies a path to salvation, but it is not without its trials. Listen closely to the riddle I present, for your fate hangs delicately in the balance of your wit and wisdom. Answer correctly, and the sands shall part, guiding you to safety and fortune. But beware, fail in this endeavor, and the desert shall be your eternal tomb, your tale lost amidst the whispering sands.
