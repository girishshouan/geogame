GeoGame is an immersive adventure where players assume the role of a detective, travelling across various countries depicted as escape rooms. Each room presents country-specific questions that players must answer to progress. 
The game aims to educate about different cultures and geographies while maintaining a thrilling narrative. Features include time limits and a maximum number of incorrect attempts to increase challenge and discourage guessing.

-Installation guide for developers 
After cloning the repository and installing Godot 4, the user simply needs to locate the “project.godot” file on the disk. Executing that file will load the project in the Godot 4 game engine which can then be modified. 
We have used an additional package in Godot to handle the dialogues. This is the “Dialogue Manager” package, details of which can be found here. To sum up, developers can follow these steps to install and make changes to the game: 

1. Download and install Godot 4. 
2. Clone the Geogame sourcecode. 
3. Checkout the “develop” branch. (can be done via git checkout) 
4. Open the “project.godot” file in Godot 4. 
5. Make changes to the code. 
6. Create a pull request on the “develop” branch.
